    <p class="stupidp">I am Horse Man. I am the child of two centaurs and through unlucky genetics, I was born 100%
        horse bodied with a
        human mind. While this caused incessant bullying and other challenges in my younger years, these unique traits
        of mine gave me a keen sense of otherness that drove me to empathize with others and encourage equity and
        kindess in all sorts of circles.
        <br>
        Due to my constant interest in politics and the experiences of youth, I am a driven educator at Centaurus High
        School and hope to continue shaping young minds.
